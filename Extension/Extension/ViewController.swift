       //MARK: - The developers set out on their journey, determined to rise to the challenge. They began by creating an extension for String that would allow the citizens to easily check if a string was a palindrome, a word or phrase that reads the same forwards as backwards. The citizens were thrilled with this new feature and it quickly became a favorite among the kingdom's bards and poets.
        
        let word = "mehmettemhem"
        print(word.isPalindrome())
        
        // MARK: - 
        
    }
