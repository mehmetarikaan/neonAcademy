       //MARK: - The developers set out on their journey, determined to rise to the challenge. They began by creating an extension for String that would allow the citizens to easily check if a string was a palindrome, a word or phrase that reads the same forwards as backwards. The citizens were thrilled with this new feature and it quickly became a favorite among the kingdom's bards and poets.
        
        let word = "mehmettemhem"
        print("String Task: \(word.isPalindrome())")
        
        // MARK: - Next, the developers tackled the Int extension. They added a function that would determine if a number was prime, which made solving mathematical puzzles much easier for the kingdom's scholars. The citizens were amazed by this new tool and it quickly became a staple in the kingdom's schools.
        let numberPrime = 7
        print("Int Task: \(numberPrime.prime(number: numberPrime))")
        
    }
}
